Data refers to raw facts and figures that can be processed to generate meaningful information.
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines elements of statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise to analyze and interpret complex data sets.
Data analysis is the process of systematically examining data to draw conclusions, identify patterns, and support decision-making.

Key components of data science/analysis include:
Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources, such as databases, online platforms, and sensors.
**Data Cleaning: Preprocessing data to remove errors and inconsistencies, ensuring it's ready for analysis.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using statistical techniques and visualization tools to explore and summarize data.
**Modeling: Applying machine learning or statistical models to make predictions or uncover patterns.
**Interpretation: Analyzing the results to draw meaningful conclusions and provide insights for decision-making.
Communication: Presenting findings clearly to stakeholders, often through visualizations and reports.
